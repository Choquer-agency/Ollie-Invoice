⭐️ PROJECT SCOPE — “Simple Invoice App”

A Cal.com-style, ultra-simple invoicing + payments tool for small businesses under $500K revenue.

1. Product Overview (High-Level Vision)

Build a minimalist, fast, beautiful invoicing platform that allows small businesses to:

Create an invoice

Send it (email + shareable link)

Get paid (Stripe checkout)

Track status (Paid, Unpaid, Overdue)

This should be built with Cal.com-level simplicity, a clean UI, and a fast workflow designed for businesses that do not want complex accounting software.

2. Core Product Principles

The product must emphasize:

1. Simplicity

Every screen clean, minimal, obvious.

2. Speed

User should be able to create and send an invoice within 10–15 seconds.

3. Beautiful design

Aesthetic: Apple-level spacing, Cal.com layout simplicity, Stripe-quality forms.

4. Multi-device usability

Optimized for desktop and mobile.

3. User Personas (who we are building for)

Small service-based businesses under $500K revenue

Trades (HVAC, plumbers, handymen, electricians, painters)

Creators and freelancers

Coaches and consultants

Micro-agencies
